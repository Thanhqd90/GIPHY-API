Pokemon themed website application using Giphy API. 

Objective of assignment was to have buttons display on the browser upon page load.  Users may add their own buttons through an input box. 
I chose to have my default and new buttons to appear in different sections of the page.  I nested my gifs inside of a card body from bootstrap.
Attempted to work on a favorites tab but I was unable to utilize a navigation tab and decided I will past on that feature.  
Download links do work if you right click and save as.
